# Some personal thoughts
The pace I kept was my peak crunch pace and is pretty much unsustainable for longer periods. A more realistic maintainable pace would be more like 2.5-3/4 of the work that got done within this timeframe.

# What is missing?
For one there is no test mocks. Was hoping to have some time over in the end to mock some test for the `Button` and `Quantity` component but instead opted to disregard it when time was running out. I normally don't test my svelte components so it would've been inefficient use of my time in installing a test suite instead of owning up to the fact that this is something i normally don't do.

Accessibility. Except using semantic markup and proper HTML5 elements which provides it by default. Some buttons and navigations are labeled. 

# What needs to be improved
Tunneled on the product content a bit. So while coding, the cart-products-heading labels was more or less an afterthought and the Cart component turned a bit messy. Would like to revisit it and clean it up and see if it can be structured differently to care a bit more about the vertical realestate.

Whitespace, margins and styling is not 1-to-1 with the design and requires additional time.

# What I want to do
* top the design off with some more sections on the landing page. Some hot products, recommended products or the likes.
* revise the cart popup in terms of it's structure. I did deviate from the the sketch due to the realestate got to narrowed and not really user friendly. Maybe have the products grid be more narrow and collapsed to care for the space more.
* Break out components and create some general reusable content components.
* Overall clean it up with thought.
